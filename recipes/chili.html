        <h2>Chili with barbecued chuck roast.</h2>
        <p>This recipes requires a charcoal grill as it is made with chuck roast cooked 
            over charcoal that is then cut into small pieces and cooked in a pot with 
            various seasonings.</p>
        <p>This chili can be rather spicy but I will indicate which ingredients can 
            be left out or substituted for those who prefer a milder experience</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 pounds of beef chuck roast</li>
            <li>30 ounces of canned kidney beans)</li>
            <li>16 ounces of crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tbsp minced garlic</li>
            <li>Two diced onions (I suggest one yellow and one red onion each)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of ancho phili powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of hot chili powder (replace with regular Chili powder if desired)</li>
            <li>1 tsp of cayenne powder (leave this out if you'd prefer)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of paprika</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>Half a cup of diced jalapenos (you can adjust this for desired heat)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of red pepper flakes (add another tbsp if you want it spicier)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tsp of black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of corn starch to thicken (this can be adjusted for desired thickness)</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start the charcoal and cut the chuck into reasonably thin pieces so it chars well.</li>
            <li>Salt the meat and cook it until it's been charred and softened.</li>
            <li>While the meat is cooking mix the listed ingredients and put them in a pot.</li>
            <li>When the meat is done cut it into the smallest pieces you can and add it to the pot.</li>
            <li>Simmer on the lowest setting for about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let the chili sit until it is cool enough to eat.</li>
        </ol>

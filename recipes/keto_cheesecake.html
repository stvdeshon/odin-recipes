        <h2>Cheesecake for people on Keto diets</h2>
        <p>Although this is a Keto cheesecake it's almost indistinguishable from regular cheesecake.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the only difference is the crust. Oh, and be warned, there is a laxative effect with certain sweeteners.</p>
        <p>To avoid severe gastrointestinal consequences I suggest using monkfruit instead of erythritol or xylitol.</p>
        <p>Before you get started you will need a 10-inch spingform pan to bake this in.</p>
        <h3>Crust Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups of almond flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of monkfruit sweetener</li>
            <li>1 tsp of cinnamon</li>
            <li>6 tbsp of melted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Filling Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>48 ounces of cream cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup of sour cream</li>
            <li>2 cups of monkfruit sweetener</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>5 eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 Fahrenheit</li>
            <li>Mix the crust ingredients, adding the butter last</li>
            <li>Form the crust around the springform pan and set it in the fridge to set up for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the filling ingredients one at a time (preferably into a stand mixer) and mix.</li>
            <li>Add the filling to the crust and put it in the oven for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>At this point you should start checking the consistency for doneness (the top should look matte).</li>
            <li>Let the cake cool in the oven for at least half an hour or it might split.</li>
            <li>Remove the cake and loosen it with a knife then let it cool until you're ready to serve it.</li>
        </ol>
